							In 2000, almost 1.7Bn people were living in water-scarce areas. As of right
							now
							(2020), that number has skyrocketed to 2.3Bn. And in 2030, it is expected to
							be 2.7Bn.
						</p>

							Water scarcity is a growing issue that is rapidly increasing on every continent on
							earth,
							but some
							locations are far more exposed to this issue. We see these issues growing much
							faster in
							countries closer to the equator, increased temperatures and extended periods of
							drought
							contribute to the matter. A growing number of regions are reporting that they are
							reaching
							the limits for sustainable delivery of water. Water could be scarce due to physical
							shortage, mostly refers to as "Physical Water Scarcity". Physical scarcity is a
							result of a
							population that grows immensely every day. Water scarcity can also be caused by a
							lack of
							infrastructure or constitutional neglect that results in an inability to ensure a
							regular
							supply, this is known as "Economical Water Scarcity". Many regions that suffer from
							the
							"Economical" version of water scarcity is rapidly growing urban areas where
							neighboring
							water resources are put under heavy pressure. The crisis is not a global event, as
							of right
							now. But individual countries are suffering greatly, and need to tackle the problems
							that
							the water scarcity puts on the regions. Changes in how available water is to the public will
							also heavily affect general health and reduce food quality. According to <a
								href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/27b53d18-6069-45f7-a1bd-d5a48bc80322/downloads/1c2meuvon_105010.pdf"
								target="_blank" title="Water publication 2013" rel="noreferrer"><strong>GWI</strong></a>,
							roughly 700
							million people all
							over the world may be displaced due to water scarcity by 2030.
							<br>
							<br>
                            Statistics show that the world's water use has grown at twice the rate of the population increase over the world.
                            The fact that over 2 billion people today live in constant water stress today,
                            and with increasing heavy load on our environment makes us and our partners believe that these numbers only will rise in the future.
                            In many countries around the world, women and girls have the primary responsibility to manage the household water supply. Firstly, this is in many cases a time-consuming and heavy-duty,
                            instead of working or acquiring education. Secondly, without freshwater that is safe to consume and to maintain adequate hygiene at home, the rate of pregnancy-failure will increase, alongside water carried diseases.
                            Even tho we don't have extensive coverage of the COVID-19 spread in some of these zones that are heavily affected by water scarcity, the hygiene issue it creates would make the containment of the virus harder to maintain.

                            <!--/subheader-->
							<p>
								There are multiple reasons and then some as to why water is becoming a scarce resource
								on
								our planet. Our earth contains an immense amount of water, however, the oceans are to
								the 99nth percentile consisting of salt water, making it it undrinkable. And the vast
								majority of freshwater is locked inside glaciers or under snow, making water a much more
								rare
								resource than one might think.
							</p>
							<p>
								Water being scarce across the global has already proven to create political instability
								and even trigger refugee dynamics. With temperatures rising to more extreme levels,
								weather becomes less predictable, an exaple is many of the countries that relies on
								heavy rainfall, snowmelt, groundwater or rivers may expect severe decline in water
								quality due to the rising temperatures.
								<br>
								<br>
                                Overexploitation of natural resources is a major jeopardization of our natural ecosystems in lakes, rivers and, other aquatic sectors.
                                This will and have had dire consequences on the reliability and sustainability of water supplies in adjacent areas.
                                As mentioned above, the "Economical Water Scarcity" may afflict political standings in countries that share water resources.
                                Imagine if you are living on one side of a big freshwater river, and recently,
                                the country on the other side built a big factory needing water to cool their turbines, as well as the pollution eventually rendering the water unusable for individuals.
                                Once the entire lake is depleted, the risk now is that saltwater intrusion from coastal areas bringing in toxins like arsenic and fluoride, killing the nearby crops.
                                While the conflicts play a part in the issue, <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/water/"
									target="_blank" title="the water convention"
									rel="noreferrer"><strong>according to UNECE</strong></a>
								only 37 incidents of
								acute conflict over water areas have been reported since 1948,
								and almost 300 agreements were negotiated and signed to cover these waters.
								<br>
								<br>
Finances are a problem here. The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6" target="_blank"
									title="united nations sustainable development goal"
									rel="noreferrer"><strong>UN SDG-6</strong></a>
								which is to reach everyone with "W.A.S.H" (water, sanitation, and hygiene) by 2030 is
								ambitious, however, this is a crucial goal to eradicate extreme poverty.
								But 80% of the countries that signed on for the SDG6 agreement reports insufficient
								financing for the goal.
								The main source of finance towards this project comes from taxing individuals and
								businesses, tariffs paid by households and governments, and the provision of goodwill.
								And there are significant gaps in between actually financing, governance, and policies
								and the aspiration to make W.A.S.H's reach a global reality. It is projected that even
								without considering operational and maintenance costs, the financial aid needs to be
								tripled to achieve the goal.

								3.4 million people die each year from scarce and contaminated water sources around the
								globe. As mentioned
								above, many millions of children and women spend up to six hours every day collecting
								water, from sources that are located far away and in many cases polluted. Those six
								hours
								is time spent not generating income, tending to family members, or going to school.
								And at any given moment, almost half of every hospital bed is occupied by a patient
								that's suffering from diseases directly connected to the lack of access to clean water.
								<br>
								<br>
                                To work against this crisis is a global undertaking. Different parts of the
								planet consume different amounts of water.
								And some targets must be more prioritized than others. The infrastructure of water
								transportation and conservation must be improved, as these are key components
								towards a sustainable life and accomplishing the SDG-6 goals. The farming and agriculture
								sector consumes much more water than any other sector on earth, and examples of clean
								technology
								that does not require water to run are being used to reduce the amount of water needed
								to sustain the farms. Technology is greatly improving our lives and also how we handle
								our water in new ways.

                                Learn how to recycle wastewater will become a much larger part of our lives soon, no, not showering, or not flushing the toilets is not what I mean. But harvesting rainwater and allowing groundwater to naturally recharge.
                                This is called, 'Groundwater Recharge' allowing water on the surface of the earth to eventually return to groundwater, a century-old process to prevent scarcity.
                                With the lack of sanitation and proper sewage, the water will be unsafe to drink, because it will be contaminated with numerous diseases.
                                Monitoring and measuring the quality of the waters around the globe is paramount to maintaining water that is clean enough to consume, where ever in the world we are.
                                This is one, if not the biggest issue to making scarcity prevention a global movement.
                                Many places that are affected the hardest are small villages or places that are hard to reach on foot, nevertheless with heavy equipment to measure the cleanliness of the water.
                                Many organizations today have developed smaller devices to measure the quality of the water, with nothing more than a slightly large syringe.
                                While this does nothing to handle the level of quality in the waters, it gives scientists and researchers an idea of what and where things are happening.
								<br>
								<br>
                                All of these things may seem hard to contribute to, and they are unless you are a scientist to help develop products, or wealthy enough to donate substantial amounts of money.
                                But the most important thing, that no money can buy, is to learn, to be aware and educate ourselves about the issue. To eradicate water scarcity from our future on this planet, it is of critical value
                                that we reform all forms of consumption, from individual useers and large corporations. And if we are educated about the matter we will be able to handle it better.
