							This video is a simple explanation on what water scarcity is, and how it affects us. While
							it is very narrow in its information, it covers a lot of ground about the pressing issue.
						</p>
						<h1 class="display-3 jumbo-header">Why is this important?
						</h1>
						<p class="lead">
							It is essential that we educate ourselves about what water crises is, and what it can do to
							our lives.
							But further down the line, it is not only our lives that is at stake. Our children, their
							children. The animals that we share this planet with.
							All of us will face the aftermaths of overconsumption of water. And for the same reason we
							teach our children about major historical events, in some ways
							to prevent them from happening again, we must learn about water to be able to forward that
							information.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major reasons to water scarcity as mentioned on the <a
								href="index.html#causes"><strong>Why is it Happening</strong></a> is pollution,
							population, agriculture, and a global climate change.
							To combat these clobal effects, we look towards big organizations to make the moves. And one
							of the biggest non political organizations in this is the <a
								href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity"><strong>World Wildlife Foundation</strong></a>.
							While their name might tell that they work for wildlife only, the water issues are a major
							concern for both humanity such as animals on earth.
							<br>
							<br>
                            One international treaty was established to protect wetlands around the globe, the <a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/"><strong>"Ramsar Convention"</strong></a>.
							The treaty was established to hold the country where these wetlands are located accountable
							and committed to protecting those wetlands. One example is, Sweden, where I am from.
							Sweden entered the treaty in april 5th, 1975, and currently holds 68 wetlands.<a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland"><strong>UK</strong></a>
							and <a href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/mexico"><strong>Mexico</strong></a> trumps
							Sweden with quite a margin. the UK has almost 1.3 million hectares of important wetlands,
							while Mexico has a mindblowing 8.6million hectares.
							Between those two countries, Mexico has a much larger problem with water and its
							sustainability, but has six times as much wetlands of international importance according to
							the Ramsar report.
							Overpopulation, pollution, and climate change arguably has hit Mexico harder than the UK.
							This is the message I want to convey, that the ammount of wetlands does not equal to usable
							water.

							<p>With all the technologies in the world today, I want to cover the <a

							<h1 class="display-3 jumbo-header" id="water-facts">Water Facts

							<p>
								Trying to measure individuals water consumption is hard, but with help from another
								major organisation, namely the<a
									href="https://waterfootprint.org/en/"><strong>Water Footprint Network</strong></a>.
								This will go into much more detailed and nuanced information.
								The WFN, together with a large network of organisations and professionals are concerned
								with the increasing water scarcity and pollution on our planet.
								I want to give you a few interesting facts about water consumption we usually might not
								think about. But first I want to quote an article from 2010 that was written by <a
									href="http://www.un-ihe.org/"><strong>UNESCO-IHE, Institute for Water Education</strong></a>:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="block-styling"
								cite="https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf">
								"We follow the water footprint definitions and methodology as set out in Hoekstra et al.
								(2009). The blue water
								footprint refers to consumption of blue water resources (surface and groundwater) along
								the supply chain of a
								product. ‘Consumption’ refers to loss of water from the available ground-surface water
								body in a catchment area.
								Losses occur when water evaporates, returns to another catchment area or the sea or is
								incorporated into a
								product. The green water footprint refers to consumption of green water resources
								(rainwater in so far as it does
								not become run-off). The grey water footprint refers to pollution and is defined as the
								volume of freshwater that
								is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations
								and existing ambient
								water quality standards."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								From this, quite hard-to-read quote we take away that, the WaterFootprintNetwork uses three different
								labels on what they use to measure water consumption. Let me
								explain them more in detail.
								<div>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="green-print">The Green Water Footprint</strong> is measuring
										water from precipitation
										that is stored in the root zone of the
										soil and evaporated, transpired or incorporated by plants.
										It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horicultural and forestry producs.
									</p>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="blue-print">The Blue Water Footprint</strong> is water that
										has been sourced from
										surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated, incorporated into a
										product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at
										a different time. Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can
										each have a blue water footprint.
									</p>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="gray-print">The Gray Water Footprint</strong> is the amount of fresh water required
										to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards. The grey
										water footprint considers point-source pollution discharged to a freshwater
										resource directly through a pipe or indirectly through runoff or leaching from
										the soil, impervious surfaces, or other diffuse sources
									</p>
								</div>

								Now we know about the footprints, and what they mean. Now we can get to the facts. A
								intimidating fact about water footprints is how large the numbers can become. The global water
								footprint of humanity during the span of 1996-2005 was 9087Bn of cubic meters per year.
                                (<strong class="green-print">74% green</strong>, <strong class="blue-print">11% blue</strong>, <strong class="gray-print">15% grey</strong>).
                                Agricultural production contributes 92% to this total footprint.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                On a smaller scale we can compare the water footprint of a soy burger produced in the Netherlands. That water footprint is roughly 160 litres.
                                While a beef burger produced in the same country costs on avarage 1000 litres. Or the fac that Japan with an avarage footprint of 1380 cubic metres per year and capita. 
                                And that 77% of that has its water footprint outside the country border.
                                The United States recives a much more concerning verdict. With a yearly consumption of 2840 cubic meter per year and capita, and 20% of that footprint is external.
                                What this means is that the citizens of the US is consuming water on other countries behalf, the largest external footprint this cunsumption makes is in the Yangtze River Basin, China.
                                This River has it's own issues, according to a dutch research fundation, together with 9 other rivers it transports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze#Contribution_to_ocean_pollution"><strong>90% of all plastics that reaches the ocean.</strong></a>   exporting drinking water is apparently not one of them.

							<h1 class="display-3 jumbo-header" id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?
							</h1>
							<p>
								3.4 million people die each year from scarce and contaminated water source. As mentioned
								above, many millions of children and women spend up to six hours every day collecting
								water, from sources that is located far away and in many cases polluted. Those six hours
								are time spent not generating income, tending to family members or going to school.
								And at any given moment, almost half of every hospital bed is occupied by a patient
								thats suffering from diseases directly connected to the lack of acces to clean water.
								<br>
								<br>
                                To work against this crisis is a global undertaking. Different parts of the
								planet consumes different ammounts of water.
								And some targets must be more prioritized than other. The infrastructure of water
								transportation and conservation must be improved, as these are key components
								towards a sustainable life and accomplising the SDG-6 goals. The farming and aggriculture
								secture consumes much more water than any other sector on earth, and examples of clean
								technology
								that does not require water to run is being used to reduce the ammount of water needed
								to sustain the farms. Technology is greatly improving our lifes and also how we handle
								our water in new ways.
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_desalination#:~:text=Solar%20desalination%20is%20a%20technique,to%20power%20a%20membrane%20process."
									target="_blank"><strong>Solar
									desalination</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation_controller"
									target="_blank"><strong>smart irrigation</strong></a> is
								only two of many new savy technologies that keeps over consumption of water to a
								minimum. Read more about what organisations are doing on our <a href="partners.html"

                                Learn how to recycle wastewater will become a much larger part of our lifes in the near future, no, not not showering, or not flushing the toilets. But harvesting rainwater and allowing groundwater to naturally recharge.
                                This is called, 'Groundwater Recharge' allowing water on the surface to the earth to eventually return to groundwater, a century old process to prevent scarcity.
                                With the lack of sanitation and proper sewage the water will be unsafe to drink, because it will be contaminated with noumerus diseases.
                                Monitoring and measuring the quality of the waters around the globe is paramount to maintaining water that is clean enough to consume, where ever in the world we are.
                                This is one, if not the biggest issue to making the scarcity prevention a global movement.
                                Many places that is affected the hardest is small villages or places that are hard to reach on foot, nevertheless with heavy equipment to measure the cleanliness of water.
                                Many organisations today have developed smaller devices to measure the quality of the water, with nothing more than a slightly large siringe.
                                While this does nothing to handle the level of quality in the waters, it gives scientists and researchers an idea of what and where things are happening.
								<br>
								<br>
                                All of these things may seem hard to contribute to, and they are, unless you are a scientist to help develop products, or wealthy enough to donate substantial ammounts of money.
                                But the most important thing, that no money can buy, is to learn, to be aware and educate ourselves about the issue. To eradicate water scarcity from our future on this planet, it is of critical value
                                that we reform all forms of consumption, from individual use and large corporations. And if we are educated about the matter we will be able to handle it better.
                                There are hundreds of resources that helps education people daily, read more about those<a
