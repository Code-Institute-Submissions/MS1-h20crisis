							This video is a simple explanation on what water scarcity is, and how it affects us. While
							it is very narrow in its information, it covers a lot of ground about the pressing issue.
						</p>
						<h1 class="display-3 jumbo-header">Why is this important?
						</h1>
						<p class="lead">
							It is essential that we educate ourselves about what water crises is, and what it can do to
							our lives.
							But further down the line, it is not only our lives that is at stake. Our children, their
							children. The animals that we share this planet with.
							All of us will face the aftermaths of overconsumption of water. And for the same reason we
							teach our children about major historical events, in some ways
							to prevent them from happening again, we must learn about water to be able to forward that
							information.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major reasons to water scarcity as mentioned on the <a
								href="index.html#causes"><strong>Why is it Happening</strong></a> is pollution,
							population, agriculture, and a global climate change.
							To combat these clobal effects, we look towards big organizations to make the moves. And one
							of the biggest non political organizations in this is the <a
								href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity"><strong>World Wildlife Foundation</strong></a>.
							While their name might tell that they work for wildlife only, the water issues are a major
							concern for both humanity such as animals on earth.
							<br>
							<br>
                            One international treaty was established to protect wetlands around the globe, the <a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/"><strong>"Ramsar Convention"</strong></a>.
							The treaty was established to hold the country where these wetlands are located accountable
							and committed to protecting those wetlands. One example is, Sweden, where I am from.
							Sweden entered the treaty in april 5th, 1975, and currently holds 68 wetlands.<a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland"><strong>UK</strong></a>
							and <a href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/mexico"><strong>Mexico</strong></a> trumps Sweden with quite a margin. the UK has almost 1.3 million hectares of important wetlands, while Mexico has a mindblowing 8.6million hectares.
                            Between those two countries, Mexico has a much larger problem with water and its sustainability, but has six times as much wetlands of international importance according to the Ramsar report.
                            Overpopulation, pollution, and climate change arguably has hit Mexico harder than the UK. This is the message I want to convey, that the ammount of wetlands does not equal to usable water.

                            <p>With all the technologies in the world today, I want to cover the <a href="index.html#causes"><strong>SDG-6</strong></a> with this video. </p>

							3.4 million people die each year from scarce and contaminated water source. As mentioned
							above, many millions of children and women spend up to six hours every day collecting
							water, from sources that is located far away and in many cases polluted. Those six hours
							are time spent not generating income, tending to family members or going to school.
							And at any given moment, almost half of every hospital bed is occupied by a patient
							thats suffering from diseases directly connected to the lack of acces to clean water.
							<br>
							<br>
                                To work against this crisis is a global undertaking. Different parts of the
								planet consumes different ammounts of water.
								And some targets must be more prioritized than other. The infrastructure of water
								transportation and conservation must be improved, as these are key components
								towards a sustainable life and accomplising the SDG-6 goals. The farming and aggriculture
								secture consumes much more water than any other sector on earth, and examples of clean
								technology
								that does not require water to run is being used to reduce the ammount of water needed
								to sustain the farms. Technology is greatly improving our lifes and also how we handle
								our water in new ways.

                                Learn how to recycle wastewater will become a much larger part of our lifes in the near future, no, not not showering, or not flushing the toilets. But harvesting rainwater and allowing groundwater to naturally recharge.
                                This is called, 'Groundwater Recharge' allowing water on the surface to the earth to eventually return to groundwater, a century old process to prevent scarcity.
                                With the lack of sanitation and proper sewage the water will be unsafe to drink, because it will be contaminated with noumerus diseases.
                                Monitoring and measuring the quality of the waters around the globe is paramount to maintaining water that is clean enough to consume, where ever in the world we are.
                                This is one, if not the biggest issue to making the scarcity prevention a global movement.
                                Many places that is affected the hardest is small villages or places that are hard to reach on foot, nevertheless with heavy equipment to measure the cleanliness of water.
                                Many organisations today have developed smaller devices to measure the quality of the water, with nothing more than a slightly large siringe.
                                While this does nothing to handle the level of quality in the waters, it gives scientists and researchers an idea of what and where things are happening.
							<br>
							<br>
                                All of these things may seem hard to contribute to, and they are, unless you are a scientist to help develop products, or wealthy enough to donate substantial ammounts of money.
                                But the most important thing, that no money can buy, is to learn, to be aware and educate ourselves about the issue. To eradicate water scarcity from our future on this planet, it is of critical value
                                that we reform all forms of consumption, from individual use and large corporations. And if we are educated about the matter we will be able to handle it better.
                                There are hundreds of resources that helps education people daily, read more about those<a
