							This video is a simple explanation of what water scarcity is, and how it affects us. While
							it is shallow in its information, it covers a lot of ground about the pressing issue.

						<!--subheader-->
						<h1 class="display-3 jumbo-header">Why is this important?
						</h1>
						<!--/subheader-->
						<p class="lead">
							We must educate ourselves about what water crises are, and what it can do to
							our lives.
							But further down the line, it is not only our lives that are at stake. Our children, their
							children. The animals that we share this planet with.
							All of us will face the aftermath of overconsumption of water. And for the same reason we
							teach our children about major historical events, in some ways
							to prevent them from happening again, we must learn about water to be able to forward that
							information.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major reasons for water scarcity as mentioned in <a
								href="index.html#causes"><strong>Why is it Happening Page</strong></a> are pollution,
							population, agriculture, and global climate change.
							To combat these effects, we look towards big organizations to make the moves. And one
							of the biggest non-political organizations in this is the <a
								href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity" target="_blank"
								alt="world wildlife foundation"><strong>World Wildlife Foundation<sup class="super-styling">2</sup></strong></a>.
							While their name might tell that they work for wildlife only, the water issues are a major
							concern for both humanities such as animals on earth.

							<br>
                            One international treaty was established to protect wetlands around the globe, the <a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/" target="_blank"
								alt="ramsar"><strong>"Ramsar Convention<sup class="super-styling">3</sup>"</strong></a>.
							The treaty was established to hold the country where these wetlands are located accountable
							and committed to protecting those wetlands. One example is Sweden, where I am from.
							Sweden entered the treaty on April 5th, 1975, and currently <a
								href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/sweden" target="_blank"
								alt="ramsar"><strong> 68 wetlands<sup class="super-styling">4</sup></strong></a>.<a

								target="_blank" alt="ramsar"><strong>UK<sup class="super-styling">4</sup></strong></a>
							and <a href="https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/mexico" target="_blank"
								alt="ramsar"><strong>Mexico<sup class="super-styling">4</sup></strong></a> trump
							Sweden with quite a margin. the UK has almost 1.3 million hectares of important wetlands,
							while Mexico has a mindblowing 8.6million hectares.
							Between those two countries, Mexico has a much larger problem with water and its
							sustainability but has six times as many wetlands of international importance according to
							the Ramsar report.
							Overpopulation, pollution, and climate change have hit Mexico harder than the UK.
							This is the message I want to convey, that the amount of wetlands does not equal usable
							water.

								Trying to measure individual's water consumption is hard, but with help from another
								major organization, namely the <a
									href="https://waterfootprint.org/en/"><strong>Water Footprint Network</strong><sup class="syper-styling">5</sup></a>.
								This will go into much more detailed and nuanced information.
								The WFN, together with a large network of organizations and professionals are concerned
								with the increasing water scarcity and pollution on our planet.
								I want to give you a few interesting facts about water consumption we usually might not
								think about. But first I want to quote an article from 2010 that was written by <a
									href="http://www.un-ihe.org/"
									target="_blank"><strong>UNESCO-IHE, Institute for Water Education</strong></a>:
							</p>
							<!--blockquote in container-->
							<blockquote class="block-styling"
								cite="https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf">
								"We follow the water footprint definitions and methodology as set out in Hoekstra et al.
								(2009). The blue water
								footprint refers to consumption of blue water resources (surface and groundwater) along
								the supply chain of a
								product. ‘Consumption’ refers to loss of water from the available ground-surface water
								body in a catchment area.
								Losses occur when water evaporates, returns to another catchment area or the sea or is
								incorporated into a
								product. The green water footprint refers to consumption of green water resources
								(rainwater in so far as it does
								not become run-off). The grey water footprint refers to pollution and is defined as the
								volume of freshwater that
								is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations
								and existing ambient
								water quality standards. <a

							<p>
								From this, hard-to-read quote we take away that, the WaterFootprintNetwork uses
								three different
								labels on what they use to measure water consumption. Let me
								explain them more in detail.
								<!--custom styled text in container-->
								<div>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="green-print">The Green Water Footprint</strong> is measuring
										water from precipitation
										that is stored in the root zone of the
										soil and evaporated, transpired or incorporated by plants.
										It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horicultural and forestry producs.
									</p>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="blue-print">The Blue Water Footprint</strong> is water that
										has been sourced from
										surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated, incorporated into a
										product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at
										a different time. Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can
										each have a blue water footprint.
									</p>
									<p class="footprint-styling">
										<strong class="gray-print">The Gray Water Footprint</strong> is the amount of
										fresh water required
										to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards. The grey
										water footprint considers point-source pollution discharged to a freshwater
										resource directly through a pipe or indirectly through runoff or leaching from
										the soil, impervious surfaces, or other diffuse sources
									</p>
								</div>
								<!--custom styled text in container-->
								Now we know about the footprints, and what they mean. Now we can get to the facts. An
								intimidating fact about water footprints is how large the numbers can become. The global
								water
								footprint of humanity during the span of 1996-2005 was 9087Bn cubic meters per year.
								(<strong class="green-print">74% green</strong>,
								<strong class="blue-print">11% blue</strong>,
								<strong class="gray-print">15% grey</strong>).
								Agricultural production contributes 92% to this total footprint.
								<br>
								<br>
                                On a smaller scale, we can compare the water footprint of a soy burger produced in the Netherlands. That water footprint is roughly 160 liters.
                                While a beef burger produced in the same country costs on avarage 1000 liters. Or the fact that Japan with an average footprint of 1380 cubic meters per year and capita.
                                And that 77% of that has its water footprint outside the country border.
                                The United States receives a much more concerning verdict. With a yearly consumption of 2840 cubic meters per year and capita, and 20% of that footprint is external.
                                What this means is that the citizens of the US are consuming water on other country's behalf, the largest external footprint this consumption makes is in the Yangtze River Basin, China.
                                This River has its own issues. according to a Dutch research foundation, the Yangtze river together with 9 other rivers transports

								Exporting that drinking water is not one of the problems it seems.
