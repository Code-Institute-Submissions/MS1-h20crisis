> ### Planning.
>
> > The project will be to create a static webpage covering the growing issues of water scarcity and overconsumption. To do this I will use **HTML**, **CSS** and possibly simpler **JavaScript**. <br>
> > The Ideas I have is to create an eyecatching but "concentrated" flow of information. Using a green**ish** color frame to further emphisize concentration and ease on the readers eye.

<hr>

> ### User Goals.
>
> > The users of this page is people that wants to gather information about the problematic states of waterconsumption all over the world, and what they can do to change it.

<hr>

> ### Host Goals.
>
> > The goal with the page is to create a easely accessable medium where crucial information about the topic is stored, and lead users towards similar information and to create incetives for users to take part in change.
> >
> > > the site will host links to organisations that are working with similar goals to further move the user towards the answer of the question; "What can I do".

# 6. External Code/Libraries/Assets

> Bootstrap Table @ resource.html line 201-275
>
> > Using a default [bootstrap table layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/) to then style it to match the site.

> Font Shadow @ (Global nav links and header element on Partner page.)
>
> > I used the CSS snippets to create a "font border" effect. I used a snipped from this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border). I mainly used this because I was afraid if screwing up any of the axis shadows.
> > And I did not want to experiment with -webkit-text-stroke. I changed the values to look better on my site.

> Global navbar
>
> > this navbar was used when I followed along the "**Progressive Enhancement with JavaScript Components - part 2**" of the Code Institute User Centric Frontend module.
> > I think here is a copy of it in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Daffie95/bootstrap-intro) as I followed along on my own project. This is the [sourcecode for that project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/blob/master/03-Components/04-progressive_enhancements_with_javascript_components-part-2/index.html).

> partners.html @ Line 33-181
>
> > This snippet is taken from [an older course project](https://github.com/Daffie95/bootstrap-intro/blob/master/index.html) the original lines are 137-187.
> > The Original code is made by me. The reason for this is that I wanted to achive something similar to what we used with rounded image circles and text following the images.

# 7. Additional Comments

> > The text content in these paragraphs are directly copied from the [Water FootPrint Webpage.](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/what-is-water-footprint/)
> > The reason for this is that I did not want to misuse or misspell any of the words, as english is not my native language those words were perticularly hard to write correctly.
