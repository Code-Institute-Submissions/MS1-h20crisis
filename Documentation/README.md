# 1. Project Planning
> ### Project Timeline.
>> The timeline can be found [Here](https://patrik-svahnstrm-team-1.monday.com/boards/879556521). 

<hr>

> ### Planning.
>> The project will be to create a static webpage covering the growing issues of water scarcity and overconsumption. To do this I will use **HTML**, **CSS** and possibly simpler **JavaScript**. <br>
The Ideas I have is to create an eyecatching but "concentrated" flow of information. Using a green**ish** color frame to further emphisize concentration and ease on the readers eye.
<hr>

> ### User Goals.
>> The users of this page is people that wants to gather information about the problematic states of waterconsumption all over the world, and what they can do to change it.
<hr>

> ### Host Goals.
>> The goal with the page is to create a easely accessable medium where crucial information about the topic is stored, and lead users towards similar information and to create incetives for users to take part in change.
>>> the site will host links to organisations that are working with similar goals to further move the user towards the answer of the question; "What can I do".

# 6. External Code/Libraries/Assets

> Bootstrap Table @ resource.html line 201-x
>> Using a default [bootstrap table layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/) to then style it to match the site.
>>

>Font Shadow @ (Global nav links and header element on Partner page.)
>> I used the CSS snippets to create a "font border" effect. I used a snipped from this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border). I mainly used this because I was afraid if screwing up any of the axis shadows.
>> And I did not want to experiment with -webkit-text-stroke. I changed the values to look better on my site.

> Global navbar
>> this navbar was used when I followed along the "**Progressive Enhancement with JavaScript Components - part 2**" of the Code Institute User Centric Frontend module.
>> I think here is a copy of it in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Daffie95/bootstrap-intro) as I followed along on my own project. This is the [sourcecode for that project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/blob/master/03-Components/04-progressive_enhancements_with_javascript_components-part-2/index.html).

>> The text content in these paragraphs are directly copied from the [Water FootPrint Webpage.](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/what-is-water-footprint/)
>> The reason for this is that I did not want to misuse or misspell any of the words, as english is not my native language those words were perticularly hard to write correctly.
