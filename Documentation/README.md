# 1. Project Planning
> ### Project Timeline.
>> The timeline can be found [Here](https://patrik-svahnstrm-team-1.monday.com/boards/879556521). 

<hr>

> ### Planning.
>> The project will be to create a static webpage covering the growing issues of water scarcity and overconsumption. To do this I will use **HTML**, **CSS** and possibly simpler **JavaScript**. <br>
The Ideas I have is to create an eyecatching but "concentrated" flow of information. Using a green**ish** color frame to further emphisize concentration and ease on the readers eye.
<hr>

> ### User Goals.
>> The users of this page would be people that wants to gather information about the problematic states of waterconsumption all over the world, and what they can do to change it.
<hr>

> ### Host Goals.
>> The goal with the page is to create a easely accessable medium where crucial information about the topic is stored, and lead users towards similar information and to create incetives for users to take part in change.
>>> the site will host links to organisations that are working with similar goals to further move the user towards the answer of the question; "What can I do".

>Global navbar
>> this navbar was used when I followed along the "**Progressive Enhancement with JavaScript Components - part 2**" of the Code Institute User Centric Frontend module.
>> I think here is a copy of it in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Daffie95/bootstrap-intro) as I followed along on my own project. This is the [sourcecode for that project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/blob/master/03-Components/04-progressive_enhancements_with_javascript_components-part-2/index.html).

> partners.html @ Line 33-181
>> This snippet is taken from [an older course project](https://github.com/Daffie95/bootstrap-intro/blob/master/index.html) the original lines are 137-187 *this is currently with placeholder text*.
>> The Original code is made by me. The reason for this is that I wanted to achive something similar to what we used with rounded image circles and text following the images.
